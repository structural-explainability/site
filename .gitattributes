# WHY: Ensures consistent line endings across Windows, macOS, and Linux
# WHY: Prevents "every line changed" diffs when collaborators use different OS
# OBS: Python/shell use LF, PowerShell uses CRLF
# REQ: Keep this file for cross-platform collaboration

# WHY: Auto-detect text files and normalize line endings
* text=auto

# WHY: Python and shell must use LF for CI/CD, Linux, containers
*.py  text eol=lf
*.sh  text eol=lf

# WHY: PowerShell convention on Windows
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# WHY: Config files use LF - standard for cross-platform tools
*.md   text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml  text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.toml text eol=lf

# WHY: Exclude docs/tests from language statistics on GitHub
docs/** linguist-documentation
tests/** linguist-documentation

# WHY: Jupyter notebooks need special diff/merge handling
*.ipynb	diff=jupyternotebook
*.ipynb	merge=jupyternotebook
