# Structural Explainability

Structural Explainability develops foundational structural constraints
on representational substrates intended to support accountability
and interoperability under persistent interpretive disagreement.

This site presents the theoretical results, formal constructions,
and adoption guidance that together define a **neutral substrate**
for accountability-oriented systems.

The work establishes what must be true of any such substrate
prior to concrete ontology design, policy frameworks,
or domain-specific implementation.
