# Overview

Modern accountability systems must function across
legal, political, ethical, and analytical disagreement.

Structural Explainability studies the **structural commitments**
that such systems cannot avoid if disagreement is persistent,
and if reference and accountability are to remain stable over time.

The focus is on:

- Ontological neutrality
- Identity and persistence
- Extension stability under incompatible interpretations

Interpretation, explanation, and evaluation are externalized by design.
