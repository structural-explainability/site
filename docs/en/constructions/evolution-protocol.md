# Evolution Protocol (EP)

The Evolution Protocol defines **neutral record structures**
for representing accountable evolutions.

It specifies entities, relationships, evolutions,
and envelopes in a time-parametric, interpretation-agnostic form.

### Design Principle

The protocol represents what happened structurally,
without asserting why it happened or whether it was justified.
