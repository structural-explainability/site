# Accountable Entities (AE)

Accountable Entities instantiate the identity-regime results
by mapping **named entity kinds**
to the six necessary and sufficient identity regimes.

This construction is structural, not domain-specific.

### Purpose

- Make identity regimes operational
- Enable consistent reference across records and systems
- Support accountability without semantic overcommitment
