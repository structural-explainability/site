# Exchange Protocol (EP)

The Exchange Protocol defines **neutral record structures**
for representing accountable exchanges.

It specifies entities, relationships, exchanges,
and envelopes in a time-parametric, interpretation-agnostic form.

### Design Principle

The protocol represents what happened structurally,
without asserting why it happened or whether it was justified.
