# Interpretation Boundary

The interpretation boundary defines where
external legal, ethical, or policy frameworks
may act upon substrate records.

### Principle

Interpretation may constrain or evaluate records,
but must not alter the neutral structural core.

This boundary preserves interoperability
across incompatible interpretive regimes.
