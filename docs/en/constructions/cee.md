# Contextual Evidence and Explanations (CEE)

CEE defines the **structural forms**
required to represent explanations, evidence groupings,
and contextual justification under disagreement.

CEE does not assert causal models,
normative conclusions, or interpretive outcomes.

### Role

- Externalize explanation from the substrate
- Preserve contestability
- Support multiple explanatory frameworks over the same records
