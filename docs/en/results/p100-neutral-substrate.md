# Neutral Substrate

This result establishes an impossibility theorem:

> Any representational substrate that remains stable
> under incompatible extensions must be pre-causal and pre-normative.

The result constrains what may appear at the foundational layer
of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate
across persistent disagreement.

## Artifacts

- Formal proof (Lean 4)
- Narrative exposition (Paper 100)

## Implication

Embedding causal models, values, obligations, or policy judgments
at the substrate level entails a loss of neutrality or extension stability.

Such commitments therefore cannot be present at the foundational layer
of a substrate intended to remain stable under persistent disagreement.
