# Identity Regimes

This result shows that exactly six identity-and-persistence regimes
are necessary and sufficient for accountability-oriented substrates
under neutrality assumptions.

Each regime corresponds to a distinct mode of persistence,
identity conditions, and reference stability.

## Artifacts

- Formal proof (Lean 4)
- Narrative exposition (Paper 200)

## Implication

Any accountability-oriented system that seeks
substrate stability under persistent disagreement
must implicitly or explicitly commit to these regimes.

Under the neutrality and independence constraints,
the set of regimes is neither reducible nor extensible
without loss of expressive adequacy.
