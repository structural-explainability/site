# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI (Docs Site)

# WHY: Validate docs and repo metadata on PRs and pushes.
# OBS: This workflow validates only; it never deploys.

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
# - CI VALIDATES, never modifies
# - Scope naming (Assemble/Baseline/Coverage/Deploy) reinforces CI/CD patterns
# - Fail fast design - catch issues early

# CI PHASES A-B-C-D:
# - Assemble: Install dependencies, verify environment setup
# - Baseline: Core validation (types exist, lint passes, tests pass)
# - Coverage: Generate coverage / testing reports
# - Deploy: Build package and docs (sanity checks for release readiness)
